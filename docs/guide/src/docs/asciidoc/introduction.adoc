Micronaut Console is extension to the https://micronaut.io/[Micronaut] applications and functions
which allows executing arbitrary code. The project has been inspired by the https://github.com/sheehan/grails-console[Grails Console Plugin].
The console does not provide any web UI but it allows you to leverage the power of your IDE. Micronaut Console provides out-of-box support
for Groovy and for any JSR223 compatible scripting engine such as built-in Ecmascript Nashorn engine or Kotlin script JSR223 wrapper.
