Micronaut Console is extension to the https://micronaut.io/[Micronaut] applications and functions
which allows executing arbitrary code. The project has been inspired by the https://github.com/sheehan/grails-console[Grails Console Plugin].
The console does not provide any web UI yet but it leverages the power of your IDE.
