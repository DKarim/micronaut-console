Micronaut Console is an extension to https://micronaut.io/[Micronaut] applications and functions
that allows executing arbitrary code. The project was inspired by the https://github.com/sheehan/grails-console[Grails Console Plugin].
The console does not provide a web UI, but it lets you leverage the power of your IDE. Micronaut Console provides out-of-the-box support
for Groovy and for any JSR223 compatible scripting engine, such as the built-in Ecmascript Nashorn engine or Kotlin script JSR223 wrapper.
